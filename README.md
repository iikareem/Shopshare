ShopShare is an innovative e-commerce platform built using the Node.js and Express framework, MongoDB for the database, and a RESTful API. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. With ShopShare, we prioritize the backend functionality to provide a seamless and secure shopping experience for our users. Key Features:

Real-time Chatting: ShopShare leverages the power of Socket.IO to enable real-time communication between buyers and sellers. This feature enhances the overall shopping experience by allowing users to ask questions, negotiate prices, and receive instant responses.

EJS View Engine: We utilize the EJS (Embedded JavaScript) view engine to dynamically render server-side templates and deliver interactive and data-driven web pages to users. EJS provides flexibility in rendering views and allows for efficient server-side processing.

JWT Authentication and Authorization: ShopShare ensures secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT enables us to authenticate users, protect sensitive routes, and provide authorized access to specific resources. This enhances the security of the platform and safeguards user information.

Backend Focus: While we recognize the importance of an appealing frontend, our primary focus in this project is on developing robust and efficient backend functionality. We prioritize creating a seamless and reliable shopping experience, emphasizing features such as inventory management, order processing, and secure payment integration.

By combining the power of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, RESTful APIs, MVC architecture, Socket.IO, EJS view engine, and JWT authentication, ShopShare offers a feature-rich and secure e-commerce platform. Our goal is to provide a seamless shopping experience, where buyers can connect with sellers in real-time, and sellers can efficiently manage their inventory and engage with customers.

Interactive Customer Support: The chatbot acts as a virtual assistant, offering immediate responses to commonly asked questions and providing guidance to users. It assists customers in navigating the platform, finding products, understanding policies, and resolving basic inquiries.
